//////////
/// Engine project

- Change the data structurs to _t
- Link the meshes and the engine vertex format to the renderer.
- Create a list of max meshes that can be represented at once in memory.

RENDERER:
	- Organize the CPU - GPU render meshes, so we can access the data when needed or delete it.


WINDOWS:
	- Use direct3D 12 for the graphics:
		- render pixel.
		- render line.
		- render a mesh.


MACOS: 
	- same setup for windows but with METAL as the graphics API.


POST IMPLEMENTATION:
- REFACTOR - Separate the engine and the application.
