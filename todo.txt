- Finishing to add the vertex buffer and index buffer for the unique mesh verteces.


////////////////////////////////

- Crate a unique vertex buffer and index buffer with all the indeces, bind to the renderer and DrawIndexed.

	Mesh importing
	- Create a hash map for the current indeces, then:
		- hash_map<key, u32> vertex exists - lookup table to quickly see if the vertex exists when importing the mesh.
				: y - then we add a new index to the index array with the already present idx of the vertex.
				: n - then create a new entry in the vertex buffer, add the new vertex idx to the hash map, and to the index buffer.


- Create a list of max meshes that can be represented at once in memory.
- Give the renderer its own arena for the textures and meshes -> separate the engine between arenas so everything is closer in memory.

RENDERER:
	<-> Organize the CPU - GPU render meshes, so we can access the data when needed or delete it.


WINDOWS:
	- Use direct3D 12 for the graphics:
		- render pixel.
		- render line.
		- render a mesh.


MACOS: 
	- same setup for windows but with METAL as the graphics API.


POST IMPLEMENTATION:
- REFACTOR - Separate the engine and the application.


STRING
- Create a string_t table to check if we have already that string in memory.
